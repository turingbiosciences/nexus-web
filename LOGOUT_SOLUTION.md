# ‚úÖ Sign-Out Issue RESOLVED

## Root Cause Found and Fixed

The sign-out was not working because of a **port mismatch** in the environment configuration.

### The Problem
- Server was running on `localhost:3001`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` was set to `localhost:3000` in `.env.local`
- Logto was redirecting to the wrong port after sign-out

### The Solution
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001` in `.env.local`

## Verification

The sign-out endpoint now correctly redirects to:
```
https://q98adz.logto.app/oidc/session/end?client_id=h28vlbexr7nmgjk5f2qdg&post_logout_redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3001
```

Notice the `post_logout_redirect_uri` now points to `localhost:3001` ‚úÖ

## Next Steps

### 1. **Logto Dashboard Configuration**
You need to ensure your Logto application has the correct redirect URLs configured:

1. Go to your [Logto Dashboard](https://cloud.logto.io)
2. Navigate to your application settings
3. Add these URLs to your **Redirect URIs**:
   - `http://localhost:3001/api/logto/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3001/api/logto/sign-in-callback`

4. Add these URLs to your **Post Sign-out Redirect URIs**:
   - `http://localhost:3001/`
   - `http://localhost:3001`

### 2. **Test the Complete Flow**
1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3001`
3. Sign in with your Logto account
4. Click "Sign Out" button
5. You should be redirected to Logto's sign-out page
6. After signing out, you should be redirected back to `http://localhost:3001`

## Environment Variables Status

‚úÖ **Correctly Set:**
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001  # ‚Üê This was the fix!
LOGTO_ENDPOINT=https://q98adz.logto.app/
LOGTO_APP_ID=h28vlbexr7nmgjk5f2qdg
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGTO_ENDPOINT=https://q98adz.logto.app/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGTO_APP_ID=h28vlbexr7nmgjk5f2qdg
```

## What Was Happening Before

1. User clicks "Sign Out"
2. App calls `/api/logto/sign-out`
3. Logto redirects to sign-out page with `post_logout_redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000`
4. After sign-out, Logto tries to redirect to `localhost:3000`
5. **FAIL**: Nothing is running on port 3000, so user sees connection error

## What Happens Now

1. User clicks "Sign Out"
2. App calls `/api/logto/sign-out`
3. Logto redirects to sign-out page with `post_logout_redirect_uri=http://localhost:3001`
4. After sign-out, Logto redirects to `localhost:3001`
5. **SUCCESS**: User is redirected back to the running application

The sign-out button should now work perfectly! üéâ
