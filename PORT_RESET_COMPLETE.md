# ✅ Port Reset Complete - Server Running on Port 3000

## Actions Taken

1. **Stopped all development instances**
   - Killed all Next.js development processes
   - Cleared port 3000 of any blocking processes

2. **Reset environment configuration**
   - Reverted `NEXTAUTH_URL` back to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Maintained all other Logto configuration

3. **Started server on port 3000**
   - Server is now running on the correct port
   - Sign-out endpoint working properly

## Current Status

✅ **Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`
✅ **Sign-out**: Working with correct redirect URL
✅ **Environment**: Properly configured for port 3000

## Verification

The sign-out endpoint now correctly redirects to:
```
https://q98adz.logto.app/oidc/session/end?client_id=h28vlbexr7nmgjk5f2qdg&post_logout_redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application**: Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Test sign-out**: The sign-out button should now work correctly
3. **Verify Logto dashboard**: Ensure your Logto application has `http://localhost:3000` configured as a redirect URI

The application is now properly configured and running on port 3000 as intended.
